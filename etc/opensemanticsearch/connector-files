# Mapping filename to URI
#

# if the users have other path (mountpoint with other path then the servers full path)
# or protocoll (http:// instead of file://)
# you can map the servers path to the users path

# default: user can access the file system, so /fullpath/filename will be mapped to file:///fullpath/filename

# If documents access not via filesystem but via website (http)
# your files in /var/www/documents/ should be mapped to http://www.opensemanticsearch.org/documents/

# UI Path navigator: Strip parts of path facet
#

# The path facet is the sidebar component to navigate (sub)paths.
# If all your different directories are in one path like /documents
# or even worse the main content dirs are subdirs like /mnt/fileserver/onesubdir and /mnt/fileserver/othersubdirectory
# you might want that the user can select or navigate the subdirectories directly (which from the content perspective are main dirs)
# instead of forcing the user first navigate to ./mnt, then to ./fileserver and so on...

# this option wont change the uri (which is the base of this option and can be mapped and stripped above),
# it will only change/strip/shorten the path facet in the interactive navigation of the user interface
#config['facet_path_strip_prefix'] = [ "file:///home/", "file://" ]
